# job-chrome-ext
A Google Chrome extension that stores resume info. Makes the job application process a little easier by keeping all common job application information in an easy-access place; no more of constantly switching tabs or searching for documents!

NOTE: Work In Progress. Publishing to demonstrate proficiency in HTML/CSS/Javascript stack.

## SHORT-TERM GOALS:
- Finish edit and save functions.
- Write functions for adding a category.
- Create hover functions that copy text to clipboard.

## LONG-TERM GOALS:
- Implement an online database in order to store information outside of a single session
- Create an autofill feature so that the extension doesn't have to be manually opened to copy information; rather, it can detect what information a field requires and suggest information to put into the text box.
- Implement a feature to upload a resume PDF so information is uploaded more easily.
